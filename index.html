    <h2>For this homework I'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.
        In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
